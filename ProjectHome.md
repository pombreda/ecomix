## Ecomix ##
Image viewer from archives (tar, zip, rar, etc) with minimalist GUI. Use Evas and Ecore from EFL (http://trac.enlightenment.org/e/wiki) for Gui. Libarchive or external programs (unar, lha, 7z) to extract data.

Image are read from memory using fmemopen (glibc only) and duplicate code from Evas or using libGraphicsMagick/libGraphicsMagickWand.

## Dependances ##
  * libevas
  * libecore
  * libecore-evas
  * libecore-file
  * libarchive
  * libmagic

and libGraphicsMagic if using libGraphicsMagick or libGraphicsMagickWand branches.

## External Programs ##
We check if they are in the PATH at runtime and we can use :

  * lha
  * 7z (7z can be a remplacement for lha)
